# Authentication Setup Guide

## What's Been Implemented

✅ **User table removed** - No more manual user management  
✅ **Supabase Auth integration** - Only authenticated users can post  
✅ **Protected admin panel** - Login required to create/edit posts  
✅ **User-specific permissions** - Users can only edit their own posts  

## How It Works Now

### **1. Authentication Flow**
- Users must sign in with Supabase Auth credentials
- Only authenticated users can access the admin panel
- Posts are automatically linked to the authenticated user

### **2. Database Schema**
```prisma
model Post {
  id           Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  title        String
  content      String?
  published    Boolean  @default(false)
  authorId     String   // Supabase Auth user ID (UUID)
  authorEmail  String   // User's email for display
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt    DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

### **3. Security Features**
- **Authentication Required**: Must be logged in to create posts
- **Ownership Protection**: Users can only edit/delete their own posts
- **Session Management**: Automatic login state management

## Setting Up Supabase Auth

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** > **Users**
3. Click **"Add user"**
4. Enter email and password for your admin user
5. Save the user

### **2. Test the Authentication**
1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit `/admin` - you'll see the login form
3. Sign in with the credentials you created in Supabase
4. You can now create posts that are linked to your account

### **3. Environment Variables**
Make sure these are set in your `.env` file:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
